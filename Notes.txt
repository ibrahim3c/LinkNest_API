	how to execute them

U can not make query or command for mulitple handlers

in ngsql u should make the query like this 
                SELECT
                "Content" as Content, // "content"  or Content is wrong 
                "CreatedAt" AS CreatedAt,
                "UserProfileId" as UserProfileId
                from "PostComment"
                where "postId"=@PostId

Please don't make the response class internal like this:
    internal class GetPostInteractionsResponse
    {
        public Guid PostId { get; init; }
        public List<InteractionInfo> InteractionInfos { get; init; }
    }
    Because when I try to return this response from the controller, it cannot be accessed.

Make commands and queries public 
Make data types of commands or queries is primtive  

i don't understand validaion behavior :()




/*
    Flow Between Frontend and Backend
    User Requests a Password Reset
        Frontend:
            User enters their email in a "Forgot Password" form.
            Frontend sends a POST request to ForgotPasswordAsync endpoint with the email.
        Backend (ForgotPasswordAsync)
            Checks if the email exists.
            Generates a password reset token.
            Sends an email with a reset link (SendPasswordResetEmailAsync).
            Returns a success message: "Please go to your email and reset your password".
    User Clicks the Reset Link in Email
        Frontend:
            Extracts userId and code from the URL.
            Displays a password reset form for the user to enter a new password.
    User Submits the New Password
        Frontend:
            Sends a POST request to ResetPasswordAsync with userId, code, and newPassword.
        Backend (ResetPasswordAsync)
            Validates input.
            Finds the user.
            Decodes the reset token.
            Resets the password using userManager.ResetPasswordAsync().
            Returns a success message: "Password Reset successfully".

Steps to implement Doamin Event
    1 - in domain layer 
        define IDomainEvent interface
        add those in base class
            public IReadOnlyList<IDomainEvent> GetDomainEvents() => _events;
            public void RaiseDomainEvent(IDomainEvent domainEvent) => _events.Add(domainEvent);
            public void ClearDomainEvents()=>_events.Clear();
        in each domain layer define a record for specific event happen to it like when user created
        so we will create record called UserCreatedDomainEvent :IDomainEvent
        and we add to to the collection in the right time like in method of created after we create the user we will add this event
    
    2 - in application layer
        define a handler of this domain event like UserCreatedDomainEventHandler:INotificationHandler<UserCreatedDomainEvent> 
        and handlee this event for example send welcome to him

    3 - In Infrastructure Layer (or Persistence Layer)
        Modify AppDbContext to dispatch domain events after saving changes

Event Flow Summary
    1 - The domain logic raises a domain event by calling RaiseDomainEvent(...).
    2 - The event is stored in a private _events list inside the entity.
    3 - When SaveChangesAsync() is called in the DbContext:
        It collects all domain events.
        Saves changes to the database.
        Then publishes the events via MediatR.
    4 - MediatR automatically invokes the appropriate handler(s) for each domain event.
    5 - The logic inside the handler (e.g., sending an email, logging, etc.) is executed.
    6 - The events are then cleared from the entity.
